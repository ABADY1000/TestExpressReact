# Server-Client project
This project is intended to test creating projects of two parts, client and server using React and ExpressJS

To run the project, clone the project using
```
git clone <github link>
```

Then go to `server` folder and run the server using commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
This will run the server on `http://localhost:9000`

Now to run client side go to `client` folder and run:

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

This will run the client side on `http://localhost:3000`
